## Troubleshooting

### AI Chat Errors

If you're seeing "Sorry, I encountered an error while processing your request":

1. **Check API Key**: Verify your Mistral API key is correctly set in `src/config.js`
2. **Console Logs**: Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab to see detailed error messages
3. **Network Tab**: Check if API requests are being made and their responses

### Auto-Apply Errors

#### "Unsupported job board" Error

**What it means**: The extension couldn't detect a supported job application form on the current page.

**How to diagnose**:

1. Open browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Run: `testJobBoard()` (this will analyze the current page)
3. Check the detection results

**Possible causes & solutions**:

**Cause 1: Not on a job application page**

```
‚ùå This page is not recognized as a job application page.
```

**Solution**: Make sure you're on a job application page with a visible form. Look for:

- Email input fields
- Name input fields
- Apply/Submit buttons
- File upload areas for resumes

**Cause 2: New/Unknown job board**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è This platform has basic support.
Confidence: 65%
```

**Solution**: The extension now supports many more platforms! Try again - we've expanded support to include:

- LinkedIn Easy Apply
- Indeed
- Glassdoor
- ZipRecruiter
- And many more ATS platforms

**Cause 3: Low confidence detection**

```
‚ùì This page might be a job application but needs verification.
Confidence: 55%
```

**Solution**: Try auto-apply anyway - it might work with the generic form detection.

#### How to Test Current Page Support

1. **Open browser console**: Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
2. **Run the test**: Type `testJobBoard()` and press Enter
3. **Check results**: Look for confidence level and platform detection

Example output:

```

üéØ Detected Platform: greenhouse
üìä Confidence: 98.0%

- **"No apply button found"**: Some forms might need manual submission after filling

## Development

### Environment Variables (Alternative)

You can also use environment variables instead of hardcoding the API key:

```bash
# Create .env file in extension root
VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
VITE_MISTRAL_BASE_URL=https://api.mistral.ai
```

### Building for Development

```bash
npm run dev  # Development build with hot reload
npm run build  # Production build
```

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify your Mistral API key configuration
3. Ensure you have a stable internet connection
